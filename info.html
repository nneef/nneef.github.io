            <p id="locbox">Little River Farms, Alpharetta, GA.</p>
            <p id="notebox">We can't wait to share our special day with you! - Emily & Nathan.</p>
            <p id="travelbox">Please note that our wedding will be over college football kickoff weekend. The game takes place the day before our wedding in downtown Atlanta. Downtown will likely be busy on Saturday, so we recommend taking I-285 from the airport to avoid downtown traffic.</p>
            <p id="airbox">The drive from the airport to downtown Alpharetta varies drastically depending on the day and the time of day you arrive. On a good day, the drive is about 45 minutes. On a bad day, it may extend to an hour and a half. There are several car rental options at the airport, as well as designated Lyft and Uber locations a short walk from the terminals.</p>
            <p id="hotelbox">For those staying at the Hamilton: We highly recommend that you park in the free parking garage just down the street from the hotel. The Hamilton only provides valet parking at $45/day. This is where we are having our room block, with a limited number of rooms available at a discount rate. Please use our discount code 'WeddingDay' to book. The code is valid for a two-night stay covering the nights of August 31st and September 1st, with check-out on September 2nd. The hotel is in the heart of downtown Alpharetta and steps away from dining and shopping. Parking: The hotel only has valet parking for $45/night. Therefore, we highly recommend parking in the nearby free parking garage that is just a short walk away!</p>
