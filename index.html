            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Nathan and Emily’s story began in Boston in March 2015. After building a strong friendship, they officially began dating in the fall of 2017, marking the start of a journey filled with love, laughter, and shared adventures.

                In 2023, Nathan proposed to Emily in Coralville, Iowa, surrounded by freshly fallen snow and eagles overhead—a perfect setting. Their relationship has thrived through their shared passions, from board game nights to serene hikes, from cozy picnics to evenings binge-watching their favorite TV shows.
                
                Now, surrounded by their closest friends and family, Nathan and Emily are thrilled to be tying the knot and beginning this exciting new chapter of their lives together.</p>
